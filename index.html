      <p>
        My name is Kiri, I'm a traditional, digital, and pixel artist;
        <br>I also do a bit of 3D modeling and animation on the side, though it's not my expertise.
        <p>I've made a <b>few</b> textures you might have seen, like the emojis and UI in <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/figura">Figura.</a></p>
        <p>I'm also working on a videogame, I'm not really sure what it's going to be about yet but it has some cute little critters in there already! </p>
        
        <br><p>I also take commissions; DM me on Discord for info on them, for now though, they are free, some examples are included in my portfolio</p>
      </p>
